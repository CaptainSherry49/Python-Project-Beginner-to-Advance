# ------------------------------- f- strings --------------------------- #
'''
To create an f-string, prefix the string with the letter “ f ”.
The string itself can be formatted in much the same way that you would with str.format().
F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed python expressions inside string literals for formatting.
'''


first = 'Sherry'
last = 'Khan'

print(f'{first} Ahmed {last}')   # using f-string we can place variable in the print statement
